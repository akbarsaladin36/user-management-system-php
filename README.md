# user-management-system-php 

This project is based on tutorial project that created by someone on youtube with hindi language. I created and followed any instruction that he's saying to me every video.
If you want an SQL file and activated this project, you must :

1. Email me at asong36@gmail.com so i will give you an SQL file that i used.
2. To activated, you must have XAMPP on your laptop or computer.
3. After activated a server at XAMPP software, you can type this link or copy : https://localhost/user_management_system.(you must create a folder to open this link).

If you need suggestion and critics, i will listening. Thanks.
